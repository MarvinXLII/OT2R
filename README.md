## ABOUT

This is a randomizer for the Steam release of Octopath Traveler II.

## OPTIONS

See the executable for full descriptions of each option. Options include:

* Shuffle job skills
* Shuffle job weapons\*
* Randomize skill JP costs
* Randomize skill power
* Shuffle support skills
* Shuffle job stats
* Shuffle chests, hidden items, NPCs' items, guild licenses
* Shuffle jerky produced from captures

* Shuffle enemies from random encounters
* Shuffle stealable items from enemies
* Shuffle items dropped by enemies
* Shuffle requirements for getting licenses from guilds

\* Many Attack animations don't exist and are messed up. Plus optimizing weapons won't work properly.

\*\* This is incomplete for some bosses.

## USAGE

Download and run the executable from the Releases page. Load the
game's Pak file, select your desired options, and press the
`Randomize` button. The randomizer will build a patch and dump it into
the folder `seed_###`. Copy the patch `rando_P.pak` into the folder
containing the game's Pak file, then load the game. If all is working,
you should see `Randomizer` on the game's title screen.
